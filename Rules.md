Setup
-----
Shuffle all 15 cards together and deal two face down to each player. Each player is also given two coins to start. Players may look at their cards.

Objective
---------
Each face down card represents one influence, when a player loses an influence they turn a card of their choice face up. When a player has lost all of their influence and their two cards are face up they are eliminated from the game. The last player remaining wins.

Game Play
---------
Players take turns taking an action. Having, or claiming to have, a card facedown gives a player the right to perform special actions. Some cards also allow you to counter the actions of other players. If one player claims to have a card facedown another player can challenge that they have the card with the loser of the challenge losing one influence. If the challenged player has the card they show it to the table, win the challenge, and exchange it for a new face down card from the dec. Challengesresolve before actions or counter actions.
